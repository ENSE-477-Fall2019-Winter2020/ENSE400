Website used for testing: http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/multi-screen-test

This website was able to test desktop layouts between 10"-24" screen sizes.
Mainly 10" screenshots were provided, however, all screen sizes available to test between 10"-24" were tested.
For the 24" screenshots, the browser was simply zoomed out on my 15" laptop.

Wanted to use Crazy Egg UX tool, however, with being in isolation and not able to leave the house,
it became too difficult and time consuming to explain to everyone how to use the Crazy Egg tool
while testing our application.

Crazy Egg is a tool that is able to display heatmaps, snapshots, and A/B testing.
