**Abstract:** It can be quite difficult when trying to find an insurance company to insure yourself with. When you are in need of an insurance plan, whether it be due to retirement, moving away from your family, or just needing a change, *Care Compare SK* is where to go. *Care Compare SK* is a web application, created by Daris Lychuk and Kegan Lavoy, that creates both a centralized place to compare multiple insurance companiesâ€™ prices as well as an online community for people to share their own experiences. *Care Compare SK* allows people to make blog posts about their individual insurance experiences and provide their personal insurance prices which can both be utilized by other members of the community to make better, more informed decision for themselves. *Care Compare SK* is also completely confidential and users do not need to enter any personal information unless they want to.
